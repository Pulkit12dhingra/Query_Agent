# Employee Information Database Documentation

## Database Overview
**Database Name:** Employee_Information.db
**Database Type:** SQLite3
**Schema Type:** Star Schema
**Total Tables:** 3
**Purpose:** Employee management system with departmental organization and performance tracking

## Schema Architecture
This database implements a star schema design with:
- 2 Dimension Tables (users, departments)
- 1 Fact Table (employee_records)
- Central hub for analytics and reporting

## Table Definitions

### 1. USERS (Dimension Table)
**Description:** Core employee information containing personal details and demographics
**Purpose:** Stores basic employee data and serves as the primary employee dimension
**Records:** ~100 employees

#### Column Details:
| Column Name | Data Type | Null Allowed | Default | Primary Key | Description |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| id          | INTEGER   | NO          | None    | YES         | Unique employee identifier (auto-increment) |
| name        | TEXT      | YES         | None    | NO          | Full employee name (First Last format) |
| age         | INTEGER   | YES         | None    | NO          | Employee age (range: 18-65 years) |

#### Business Rules:
- Primary key auto-increments for new employees
- Names are generated from predefined first/last name lists
- Age range represents working-age population (18-65)
- No constraints on name uniqueness (allows duplicate names)

#### Sample Data:
```
ID | Name             | Age
---|------------------|----
1  | John Smith       | 34
2  | Jane Johnson     | 28
3  | Michael Williams | 45
4  | Sarah Brown      | 31
5  | David Jones      | 52
```

### 2. DEPARTMENTS (Dimension Table)
**Description:** Organizational structure containing department information and management details
**Purpose:** Defines company departments with location, budget, and leadership information
**Records:** 8 departments

#### Column Details:
| Column Name | Data Type | Null Allowed | Default | Primary Key | Description |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| dept_id     | INTEGER   | NO          | None    | YES         | Unique department identifier (auto-increment) |
| dept_name   | TEXT      | NO          | None    | NO          | Department name (unique) |
| dept_head   | TEXT      | YES         | None    | NO          | Name of department head/manager |

| budget      | INTEGER   | YES         | None    | NO          | Annual department budget in USD |

#### Business Rules:
- Each department has a unique identifier and name
- Budget is stored as integer (whole dollars)
- Location refers to building assignments (A, B, C, D)
- Department head is the manager's full name

#### Department Breakdown:
```
Dept ID | Department Name        | Head             | Location  | Budget
--------|------------------------|------------------|-----------|----------
1       | Engineering            | Sarah Wilson     | Building A| $500,000

### 3. EMPLOYEE_RECORDS (Fact Table)
**Description:** Central fact table connecting employees to departments with performance and compensation metrics
**Purpose:** Stores transactional employee data for analytics and reporting
**Records:** ~100 records (one per employee)

#### Column Details:
| Column Name       | Data Type | Null Allowed | Default | Primary Key | Foreign Key | Description |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| record_id         | INTEGER   | NO          | None    | YES         | NO          | Unique record identifier (auto-increment) |
| user_id           | INTEGER   | YES         | None    | NO          | YES         | References users.id - links to employee |
| dept_id           | INTEGER   | YES         | None    | NO          | YES         | References departments.dept_id - department assignment |
| hire_date         | DATE      | YES         | None    | NO          | NO          | Employee start date (YYYY-MM-DD format) |

| performance_score | REAL      | YES         | None    | NO          | NO          | Performance rating (1.0-5.0 scale) |
| hours_worked      | INTEGER   | YES         | None    | NO          | NO          | Monthly hours worked (120-200 range) |

#### Foreign Key Relationships:
- `user_id` → `users.id` (Many-to-One: Multiple records can reference same user)
- `dept_id` → `departments.dept_id` (Many-to-One: Multiple employees per department)

#### Business Rules:
- Each employee has exactly one active record
- Hire dates range from 2020-01-01 to present (last 5 years)
- Salary varies by department with ±$15-25K variance from base
- Performance scores use 5-point scale (2.0-5.0 actual range)
- Hours worked represents monthly totals (typical range: 120-200)

#### Salary Ranges by Department:
```
Department             | Base Salary | Typical Range
-----------------------|-------------|---------------
Engineering            | $85,000     | $70,000-$110,000

## Indexes and Performance
**Primary Keys:** All tables have auto-incrementing integer primary keys
**Foreign Keys:** employee_records table maintains referential integrity
**Query Performance:** Optimized for star schema analytics queries

## Common Query Patterns

### Employee Information Lookup:
```sql
SELECT u.name, d.dept_name, er.salary, er.performance_score
FROM users u
JOIN employee_records er ON u.id = er.user_id
JOIN departments d ON er.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE u.name = 'John Smith';
```

### Department Analytics:
```sql
SELECT d.dept_name,
       COUNT(er.user_id) as employee_count,
       AVG(er.salary) as avg_salary,
       AVG(er.performance_score) as avg_performance
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN employee_records er ON d.dept_id = er.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name;
```

### Performance Reporting:
```sql
SELECT u.name, er.performance_score, er.salary, d.dept_name
FROM employee_records er
JOIN users u ON er.user_id = u.id
JOIN departments d ON er.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE er.performance_score >= 4.0
ORDER BY er.performance_score DESC;
```

## Data Quality Notes
- All employee names are randomly generated from predefined lists
- No duplicate checking on employee names (business decision)
- Age distribution is uniform across 18-65 range
- Hire dates span 5-year period (2020-2025)
- Salary data includes realistic variance by department
- Performance scores avoid extreme low values (minimum 2.0)

## Business Metrics Available
- Employee count by department
- Average salary by department and overall
- Performance distribution analysis
- Hours worked trends
- Hiring patterns over time
- Budget vs actual employee costs
- Department productivity metrics

## Maintenance Notes
- Database uses SQLite3 for simplicity and portability
- No cascading deletes implemented (manual cleanup required)
- Foreign key constraints enforced
- Sample data regenerated via create_db.ipynb notebook
- Schema supports additional fact tables for historical tracking
